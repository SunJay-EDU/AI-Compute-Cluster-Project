# AI-Compute-Cluster-Project
Project Description: 
This project involves developing an AI/ML model and training it with a "Compute Cluster". The "Compute Cluster" in this case (for me) is going to be several (old) laptops I have laying around, but you can use any computer(s) you have laying around for this. 
The purpose of this model is to essentially find the shortest path when given a 2d graph comprised of nodes, weights, etc.
(This is essentially Dijkstra's Algorithm)
