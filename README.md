# AI-Compute-Cluster-Project
## Project Description: 

This project involves developing an AI/ML model and training it with a "Compute Cluster". The "Compute Cluster" in this case (for me) is going to be several (old) laptops I have laying around, but you can use any computer(s) you have laying around for this. 

The purpose of this model is to essentially find the shortest path when given a 2d graph comprised of nodes, weights, etc.

*(This is essentially Dijkstra's Algorithm)*

Althought the model may seem unnecessary for this, the reason why I created this was to learn more about data generation, AI/ML training, and real-life server structures such as Compute Clusters.


## Project Requirements:

1. Have Python 3 installed
2. Ensure you have the required packages installed: networkx, matplotlib, PyTorch
3. Have sufficient hardware resources. Any hardware that is modern should be able to run this


## NOTE:

I am aware there are better versions to do what I just did, but feel free to use this as a "learning" resource!
